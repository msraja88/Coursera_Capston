<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>Toronto, the
capital of the province of Ontario, is the most widespread Canadian city. Its
diversity is reflected in Toronto’s ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown,
Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little
Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal &amp; Roncesvalles. One of the most
immigrant-friendly cities in Canada with more than half of the entire Indian
Canadian population be located in Toronto. it might be one of the best places
to start an Indian restaurant. In this project we will go through step by step
process to decide whether it is a good idea to open an Indian restaurant. We
analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto to identify the most profitable area since
the success of the restaurant depends on the people and ambience. Since we
already know that Toronto shelter a greater number of Indians than any other
city in Canada, it is a good idea to start the restaurant here. Let us analyze
and explore whether it is a profitable idea or not. If profitable in which place,
we can start the restaurant, so that it gets more profit to the owner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>5. Results and Discussion: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>5.1 Results </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We have reached the end of the
analysis, in this section we will document all the findings from above
clustering &amp; visualization of the dataset. In this project, we started off
with the business problem of identifying a good neighbourhood to open a new
Indian restaurant. To achieve that we looked into all the neighbourhoods in
Toronto, analysed the Indian population in each neighbourhood &amp; number of
Indian restaurants in those neighbourhoods to come to conclusion about which
neighbourhood would be a better spot. We have used variety of data sources to
set up a very realistic data-analysis scenario. We have found out that — </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>• In those 11 boroughs we
identified that only Central Toronto, Downtown Toronto, East Toronto, East
York, North York &amp; Scarborough boroughs have high amount of Indian restaurants
with the help of Violin plots between Number of Indian restaurants in Borough
of Toronto. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>• In all the ridings,
Scarborough-Guildwood, Scarborough-Rouge Park, Scarborough Centre, Scarborough
North, Humber River-Black Creek, Don Valley East, Scarborough Southwest, Don
Valley North &amp; Scarborough-Agincourt are the densely populated with Indian
crowd ridings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>• With the help of clusters
examining &amp; violin plots looks like Downtown Toronto, Central Toronto, East
York are already densely populated with Indian restaurants. So it is better
idea to leave those boroughs out and consider only Scarborough, East Toronto
&amp; North York for the new restaurant’s location. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>• After careful consideration it
is a good idea to open a new Indian restaurant in Scarborough borough since it
has high number of Indian population which gives a higher number of customers
possibility and lower competition since very less Indian restaurants in the
neighbourhoods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>5.2 Discussion </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>According to this analysis,
Scarborough borough will provide the least competition for the new upcoming
Indian restaurant as there is very little Indian restaurants spread or no
Indian restaurants in few neighbourhoods. Also looking at the population
distribution looks like it is densely populated with Indian crowd which helps
the new restaurant by providing high customer visit possibility. So, definitely
this region could potentially be a perfect place for starting a quality Indian
restaurants. Some of the drawbacks of this analysis are&#8202;—&#8202;the clustering
is completely based only on data obtained from Foursquare API and the data
about the Indian population distribution in each neighbourhood is also based on
the 2016 census which is not up-to date. Thus there is huge gap of 3 years in
the population distribution data. Even Though there are lots of areas where it
can be improved yet this analysis has certainly provided us with some good
insights, preliminary information on possibilities &amp; a head start into this
business problem by setting the step stones properly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>6. Conclusion: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Finally to conclude this project,
We have got a chance to on a business problem like how a real like data
scientists would do. We have used many python libraries to fetch the data , to
manipulate the contents &amp; to analyse and visualize those datasets. We have
made use of Foursquare API to explore the venues in neighbourhoods of Toronto,
then get good amount of data from Wikipedia which we scraped with help of
Wikipedia python library and visualized using various plots present in seaborn &amp;
matplotlib. We also applied machine learning technique to predict the output
given the data and used Folium to visualize it on a map. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Some of the drawbacks or areas of
improvements shows us that this analysis can be further improved with the help
of more data and different machine learning technique. Similarly we can use
this project to analysis any scenario such as opening a different cuisine
restaurant or opening of a new gym and etc. Hopefully, this project helps acts
as initial guidance to take more complex real-life challenges using
data-science.</p>
